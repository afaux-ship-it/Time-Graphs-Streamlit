# Graph Anything Over Time - App Overview

## Purpose
**Graph Anything Over Time** is a user-friendly Streamlit application designed to democratize time-series data visualization. The app eliminates the technical barriers that prevent users from quickly creating meaningful temporal visualizations from their datasets.

## Target Users
- **Data Analysts** who need rapid prototyping of time-series visualizations
- **Students and Researchers** working with temporal data across various disciplines
- **Business Professionals** analyzing trends, metrics, and performance over time
- **Non-technical Users** who want to visualize time-based data without coding
- **Anyone** with CSV/Excel files containing dates and numerical data

## Development Environment Setup
This project uses a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies and ensure consistent development across different machines.

### Virtual Environment Requirements
- **Python Version**: 3.8+ (recommended: 3.9-3.11)
- **Virtual Environment Tool**: `venv` (built-in) or `conda`
- **Package Manager**: `pip`
- **Environment Name**: `graph-time-env` (suggested)

```

## How It Works
The app follows a simple three-step workflow:
1. **Upload & Parse**: Users upload datasets in common formats (CSV, Excel, JSON). The app intelligently detects and parses various date/time formats automatically.
2. **Select & Configure**: Users choose their time column and variables to plot, with intuitive controls for customization.
3. **Visualize & Export**: Generate publication-ready charts with options to overlay multiple datasets, customize appearance, and export results.

## Supported Datasets
- **File Formats**: CSV, Excel (.xlsx, .xls), JSON, TSV
- **Date/Time Formats**: 
  - Standard formats (MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD)
  - Natural language dates ("February 23, 2023", "23 Feb 2023")
  - Unix timestamps (seconds/milliseconds)
  - ISO 8601 strings
  - Custom date formats with user-defined patterns
- **Data Types**: Numerical data, categorical data with time series, mixed datasets

## Problems It Solves
- **Technical Complexity**: Eliminates need for programming knowledge to create time-series plots
- **Format Inconsistency**: Handles diverse date formats without manual preprocessing
- **Multi-dataset Analysis**: Enables easy comparison of data from different sources
- **Rapid Iteration**: Allows quick exploration of different variables and time ranges
- **Presentation Ready**: Generates publication-quality visualizations with minimal effort

## Value Proposition
Transform raw temporal data into insightful visualizations in minutes, not hours. Whether you're tracking business KPIs, analyzing scientific measurements, or exploring historical trends, this app bridges the gap between data and understanding without requiring technical expertise.
